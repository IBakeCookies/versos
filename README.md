# Test

## Instructions

-   Open up the console to see the logs when events happen.

## Things

-   No eslint / prettier were added.
-   I wanted to add unit tests, but I dont have any utils functions to test... I added some component test .
-   I didnt need stores and pinia for this test by itself. (I installed Pinia but didnt uninstall it)
-   I didnt handle errors everywhere with useFetch, I handled them once or twice to show you that I handle them. Rest of the error handling for useFetch is omitted.
